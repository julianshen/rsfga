    # rsa 0.9.9 - Marvin Attack timing sidechannel (RUSTSEC-2023-0071)
    # Severity: Medium (5.9)
    # Status: No fixed upgrade available
    # Impact: This is a transitive dependency from sqlx-mysql. RSFGA does not
    # use RSA for key generation/exchange, so the risk is minimal.
    # We will monitor for upstream fixes.

    # tokio-tar 0.3.1 - PAX extended headers parsing vulnerability (RUSTSEC-2025-0111)
    # Severity: Medium
    # Status: No fixed upgrade available
    # Impact: This is a dev-dependency only (testcontainers). The vulnerability
    # involves PAX header parsing which could allow file smuggling when extracting
    # archives. RSFGA does not extract untrusted archives - testcontainers only
    # uses it for pulling trusted Docker images. Risk is minimal for test usage.
